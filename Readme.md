> a. What is the theme of your museum?

  The theme of our museum is reflecting on the tragedy of our decisions. There will be displays of anguish, pain and sleeplessness from our peers in their natural habitat, Cramer.

> b. How many rooms will your museum have?

  Our museum will have, tentatively, 4 rooms plus the outside "starting point" for the museum.

> c. Have you started looking for textures for your museum walls/floors? If so, what are your plans?

  We have looked at some nice marble textures and have plans to possibly make our own textures using Crazybump.(http://crazybump.com/)

> d. Will your museum have a ceiling?  

  Yes. And also, probably, a sky box.

> e. You must have at least ONE “sculpture” in your museum.  What are you planning to use for
    your sculpture(s)?  NOTE: You DO NOT have to create your own blender model/sculpture, you
    are free to search the internet for a pre-made model. It is more important, for me, that you
    understand how these models are represented in the computer, and how they are manipulated in
    3D space.

 We plan on using a 3d scanning software to scan in our peers as statues. There are a few nice scanning softwares with free versions. (we have not decided on which to use yet. some of the models are very low quality. Limited to 5000 polygons.)

> f. You must have at least FOUR “paintings” in your museum.  What were you planning to use for
    your pictures? Have you already started looking for textures that can be applied as “pictures”?  
   Will your pictures be hung on the wall? Will they be murals?  Do you have a completely different
    idea of how these paintings will be added to your museum

 We plan on doing a a few different "paintings" in the museum. One will only be able to be seen properly from a certain angle, one will be a normal picture, the other will be an inserted statue to look like a painting, the final one will be a top down view of a topographical map.
